Bio-integrated Software Development for Adaptive Sensor Networks

This project aims at creating software tools for the utilization of biological cells as part fo sensor motes of a sensor network.
Tools developed are related to connectivity and causality analysis between cells,
models of biological networks organizing on a Multi-Electrode Array (MEA),
pattern recognition and on-site computing from sensor motes (e.g. Raspberry Pi).
