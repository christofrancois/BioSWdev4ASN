# SiMEA
A Framework for simulating neurons on Multi-Electrode Array

This framework was developed during MSc. Vafa Andalibi's master thesis.

The two Main files of the framework are "main_locator.py" and "MEA_main.py". The main locator reads the data from .swc files, extracts the morpho from them, distributes them based on two-level inversed diamond square algorithm. Then the morphologies for the whole network is generated and rotated. The killer function is also applied and finally the connections between neurons are found and saved with as pickle files. 
In next part, MEA_main reads the file previously generated by main_locator. It uses the Brian2 Interpreter to extract the data from pickle file and interpret it for Brian2. Finally the simulation is run based on that specific network configuration.
